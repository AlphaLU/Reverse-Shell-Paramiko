# Reverse-Shell-Paramiko
Using Paramiko in order to execute a reverse shell on target machine.



# Server
Will send the requests you're making to the target machine and from that target machine back to your SFTP server 
I had set up an SFTP server on my raspberry pi in order to check everything and it worked perfectly.

# Client
Simply executes the script (should've been an executable) and gives full premissions to the user on the other end, having the ability to run CMD, take screenshots, webcam pictures.

# Plans for the future
In the future I will add encryption, including the ability to encrypt files as they're transfered into the SFTP server.
More things that will be added:
 1. Webcam videos / streaming.
 2. Full encryption (Or will try atleast).
 3. Better transparency.
